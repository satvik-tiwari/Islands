# Islands
Counting the total number of islands presents in a 2-D matrix using basics.

Consider a 2-D matrix of 0's and 1's. Now our goal is to find the number of islands present in the matrix.

A group of 0's in a matrix is considered an island. Some people call a group of 1's as an island. My code finds the number of islands by using recurssion and basic 'C' programming.
